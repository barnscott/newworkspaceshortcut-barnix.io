# New Workspace Shortcut extension for Gnome Desktop

# TLDR
This extension will enable the following:

- Move-window-to-new-workspace Shortcut: 
  - Use a shortcut to move the in-focus window to a *new* workspace on the right of your current workspace: `Ctl + Super + Shift + Right`
  - Or to the left / *backward*: `Ctl + Super + Shift + Left`
- New-empty-workspace Shortcut:
  - Use a shortcut to create an *empty* workspace on the right: `Ctl + Super + Alt + Right`
  - Or to the left / *backward*: `Ctl + Super + Alt + Left`
- Reorder-workspace Shortcut:
  - Use a shortcut to move an entire workspace left or right of the current workspace: `Ctl + Super + Left` or `Ctl + Super + Right`
  - By default, this shortcut with automatically trigger the Overview to provide a limited form of visual feedback. However, this preference can be changed via the extension's Settings panel.

These shortcuts are created to work logically with the vanilla gnome shortcuts including change-workspace (`Super + ALT + Left/Right`) and move-window-to-next-workspace (`Shift + Super + ALT + Left/Right`).

# Purpose

This extension provides a shortcut that will move the active window to a new workspace that is to the right/left of the current workspace. Alternatively, you can also create an empty workspaces.

This is useful, for example, if you have 3 populated workspaces, but you want to move a window that is on workspace-1 to a new and empty workspace to the right of workspace-1.

Without this extension, you can create a new workspace between two existing workspaces with your mouse by (1) entering Overview, (2) with your mouse, grab/drag a window from an existing workspace, (3) and drop the window in between existing workspace-thumbnails of the Overview.

However, I was looking for similar functionality with a keyboard shortcut, which does not currently exist on vanilla Gnome.

Additionally, this extension provides shortcuts to move your active Workspace left and right.
