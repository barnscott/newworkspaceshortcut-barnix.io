## CHANGES

- The shortcut to move an entire workspace left/right has been changes to `CTL+SUPER+Left/Right`. This was previously `ALT+Left/Right`, but conflicted with other app shortcuts.

- New shortcut to create new `empty` workspace on the right: `Super + Alt + n`

- New shortcut to create new `empty` workspace on the left: `Super + Alt + b`
